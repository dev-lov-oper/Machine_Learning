# LeetCode Problem Recommender

An ML-based system that recommends the **next LeetCode problem to solve** based on a user's solved problems and problem-solving patterns.

The system uses **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** to find similar problems and generate personalized recommendations.

## Features

* Fetch LeetCode problem and submission data
* Track solved problems
* Analyze topics and difficulty
* Recommend similar unsolved problems
* Personalized recommendations based on solving history
* Topic-wise solving statistics
* "Why this?" explanation for recommendations
* React dashboard

## How It Works

```text

## Recommendation Modes

### Similar Problems

Select a problem and get similar unsolved problems.

### For You

Get recommendations based on your recent solving history, difficulty, and topics.

## API

```text
GET /api/recommend/for-me/
GET /api/recommend/similar/<problem_id>/
GET /api/problems/
GET /api/problems/<problem_id>/
GET /api/stats/
```

## Development Roadmap

* [ ] LeetCode data collection
* [ ] Django database setup
* [ ] Feature engineering
* [ ] KNN recommendation model
* [ ] Django REST API
* [ ] React dashboard
* [ ] Personalized recommendations
* [ ] Deployment
* [ ] Automated data/model updates

## Goal

Build a personalized LeetCode practice assistant that learns from your solving history and continuously recommends what you should solve next.

For educational and research purposes.
